  <h4><i>Food is the fuel the body needs to replenish itself with. Each civilization has given profound importance to food types and consumption patterns.

    Hence, it can be easily assumed that food has the power to influence bodily metabolism and organ health directly. After ingestion, food is digested through our gut with the help of various digestive juices and ends in being absorbed in bloodstreams as different types of biomolecules which are known as Nutrients.
    
    If food is the reason, Nutrition is the result. We consume food so that we can obtain proper nutrition.
    
    Nutrition is the process by which important beneficial biomolecules or Nutrients, after reaching their destination within the body, positively helps in functioning, maintaining, or improving important bio metabolisms like building muscles, producing energy, thriving body cells, improving body health, replenish malnourishment, and strengthening immunity.
    <br>

      Food Nutrition Analysis helps in the detailed and perfect determination of the component nutrients present in any food item.
